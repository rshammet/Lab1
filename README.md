# Lab1
Creating a Repository for the first time.
Create a markdown cell by inserting a new cell and changing the type to markdown.
	1) When you type regularly it will appear in regular text
	2) Adding _x_ will make the x an italic x
	3) Adding **x** will make the x a bold x
	4) Adding **_x_** will make the x bold AND italic 
	5) Adding # x will make x a header
	6) Adding ## x will make x a second header (and so on)
	7) You can ilaticize a header but cant make it bold
