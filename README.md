# Lab1
Creating a Repository for the first time
Create a markdown cell by inserting a new cell and changing the type to markdown
	When you type regularly it will appear in regular text
	Adding _x_ will make the x an italic x
	Adding **x** will make the x a bold x
	Adding **_x_** will make the x bold AND italic 
	Adding # x will make x a header
	Adding ## x will make x a second header (and so on)
	You can ilaticize a header but cant make it bold
